Hello there! I'm a Fullstack JavaScript Developer who's really passionate about making cool stuffs on the web. I've been professionally at it for more than 1.5 years, and it's been quite a journey!
</p>

<p>
It all began back in university when I was studying electrical engineering. I didn't know a thing about programming until I took a course on C++ in my third semester. Honestly, I was terrified of it. The way the teacher explained things just made it seem so complex, and as a result, I didn't perform well in the exam. Despite my fears of programming, there was one thing I loved doing – tinkering around with Arduino projects. It was like my little escape.
</p>

<p>
The fear of programming haunted me until I stumbled upon Python in 2019. It had this simpler way of doing things that clicked with me. While I was working at a power plant as an electrical engineer, I found myself spending my free time learning Python. It was slow progress, but I was determined to conquer my fear of programming.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to today, and here I am, a Junior Software Developer. It's crazy how life takes unexpected turns, isn't it? In my current role as a full-stack web developer, I've delved into a range of technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Nest.js, Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Git. But as a junior developer, I'm constantly learning and evolving, drawing knowledge from experienced colleagues, the work environment, the tech community, and online resources. Technology constantly amazes me, and my goal is to solve problems for the betterment of our world and society.
</p>

<p>
I also aspire to assist the next generation in overcoming the fear of programming and any hurdles in learning. Moreover, I am passionate about empowering young individuals to utilize modern technology to address and solve pressing social issues. By fostering a supportive environment and providing resources, I aim to inspire and equip future generations to leverage technology for positive social change.
</p>

<p>
Outside of work, I've got this thing for photography. It's been a hobby of mine for a while, and I even had some of my photos displayed at the National Museum of Bangladesh. I guess you could say I've got a bit of a creative side too.

So yeah, that's me in a nutshell – just a regular guy who's passionate about problem-solving and making cool things on the web. I'm based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next.
