Hello there! I'm just a Junior Full-Stack Developer who's really passionate about making cool stuff on the web. I've been at it for about a year now, and let me tell you, it's been quite a journey!
</p>
<p>
It all started back in college when I was studying electrical engineering. I didn't know a thing about programming until I took this course on C++ in my third semester. Honestly, I was terrified of it. The way the teacher explained things just made it seem so complex. But you know what? Despite my fears, there was this one thing I loved doing – tinkering around with Arduino projects. It was like my little escape.
</p>
<p>
Then, in 2018, I stumbled upon Python. It had this simpler way of doing things that clicked with me. Even while I was working at a power plant as an electrical engineer in 2019, I found myself spending my free time learning Python. It was slow progress, but I was determined to conquer my fear of programming.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to today, and here I am, a Junior Software Developer. It's crazy how life takes unexpected turns, isn't it? I've picked up a bunch of skills along the way, like working with NestJS, React, and all sorts of other tech stuff. But I'm always learning, always trying to get better.
</p>
<p>
Outside of work, I've got this thing for photography. It's been a hobby of mine for a while, and I even had some of my photos displayed at the National Museum of Bangladesh. I guess you could say I've got a bit of a creative side too.

So yeah, that's me in a nutshell – just a regular guy who's passionate about problem-solving and making cool things on the web. I'm based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next.
