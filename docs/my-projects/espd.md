### My Contributions:
As a junior full-stack developer, I played a pivotal role in integrating backend APIs with the frontend, developing key features such as search and filtering, pagination, favorites, booking, FAQ, and "Find me a tutor." I also contributed to backend API development using Nest.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Despite facing initial challenges and errors typical of a first industry-level project, I persevered with the support of my team, learning valuable debugging techniques and expanding my knowledge of frontend and backend technologies.

### Challenges:
My journey with ESPD was marked by a steep learning curve and numerous challenges. From debugging errors to grappling with complex frontend concepts like nested mapping and React hooks, each obstacle served as a learning opportunity. Delving into SQL databases and navigating the intricacies of Nest.js broadened my understanding of backend development. Client meetings provided insight into project management and communication, enriching my overall experience as a developer.

### Conclusion:
ESPD represents more than just a project; it embodies my growth as a developer. Despite the hurdles, the journey has been immensely rewarding. Collaborating with teammates, tackling new concepts daily, and witnessing the tangible impact of our work on students' education have been invaluable experiences. As I continue my journey, I look back on ESPD with pride, grateful for the lessons learned and the skills honed along the way.
